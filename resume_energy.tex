%Please accept my resume for the student placement at Metrolinx as my experience in %conducting research, analysing data and writing technical reports makes me a strong %candidate for this position.

%As my resume indicates, I have recently completed a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree with a minor in mathematics and a specialization in alternative energy systems from the University Of Ontario Institute Of Technology.  I will be perusing a master's degree in the fall of 2015. I researched and presented a senior thesis on how optical properties of amorphous silicon carbide material are influenced by varying the material's composition.  Having taken a great amount of physics and engineering  courses as indicated in my transcript I have demonstrated that I have a solid knowledge of various applied physics concepts and an aptitude for analytical thinking. 

%Since attending UOIT, I was a co-founder and representative of the UOIT Physics Society which helped me develop crucial communication skills, and gave me experience working with a group of physics students. My physics cohorts and I were tasked by physics professors to bring together physics students and promote physics lectures in the school. My responsibilities included promoting events around campus and communicating through different social media channels. Working with the society along with my university career has helped improve my time management and leadership skills. 

%I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my skills with you in person. I can be reached at (905) 973-2472 for further information. Thank you for your time and consideration.
